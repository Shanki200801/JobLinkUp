        <p>So, what should you do to prepare for your business analyst interview?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Research the company: <br>
                Before your interview, research the company to gain a better understanding of their business model, culture, and values. This information will help you tailor your answers to the specific needs of the company and demonstrate your interest in the position.
            </li>

            <li>Prepare for behavioral questions: <br>
                Many interviewers use behavioral questions to understand how you have handled situations in the past. Prepare examples of how you have solved problems or demonstrated leadership skills, as well as examples of how you have collaborated with others to achieve a common goal.
            </li>

            <!-- Add more tips here -->

            <li>Bring examples of your work: <br>
                Bring examples of your work to the interview, such as project plans, requirements documents, or business process maps. These examples can help you demonstrate your skills and provide tangible evidence of your experience.
            </li>

            <li>Show interest in the company’s goals: <br>
                In addition to demonstrating your own skills and experience, be sure to ask questions about the company’s goals and how the business analyst role fits into their overall strategy. This demonstrates your interest in the company and your ability to think strategically.
