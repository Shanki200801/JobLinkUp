    <h1>Data Scientist Interview Tips</h1>

    <div class="tips">
        <p>Let us learn a few tips and tricks that will assist you in cracking the data science interview:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>No one expects you to know everything <br>
            Not having a specific skill is normal. If the company asks for a solution in R, but you only know how to do it in Python, demonstrate how you can solve problems with Python and show your willingness to learn R.</li>

            <li>Think before answering<br>
            Ask for more time if the question requires it. It shows that you take their questions seriously. However, do not do it for every question.</li>

            <!-- Add more tips here -->

            <li>
Explain the role of a data scientist
<br>
            Sometimes, especially at smaller companies, they may not fully know why they need a data scientist. If this is the case, emphasize how you can improve the company’s visibility and profits by enhancing the existing products or creating new solutions.</li>
        

            <li>
Industries differ
<br>
           Working as a data scientist in different domains may differ quite a lot. A biotech company is different from a cloud service provider. Spend some time to understand the specifics of the company’s domain and show the company that you want to learn. However, fundamentally anyone works with the data, and the data is approachable in similar ways no matter the industry.</li>
