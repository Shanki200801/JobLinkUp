    <h1>UI/UX Interview Tips</h1>

    <div class="tips">
        <p> Whether you’re a new UX designer or a professional, you may have to pass multiple interviews to land your dream job. The interview process can be overwhelming for anyone, so we’ve compiled these UX interview tips to help newcomers and professionals alike. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Refresh Your Soft Skills: <br>
Whether you are applying for a senior or junior UX design position, you need to ensure that your soft skills are up to par. As a manager, you should have strong interpersonal skills and communication skills, so that you can lead your team. Alternatively, a junior designer needs to be a good listener and an excellent team player. So, if your current resume doesn’t mention any of these soft skills, don’t delay and update. Practice these skills daily, so you can improve these skills before applying for a position.
            </li>

            <li>Have Examples of Good and Bad UX: <br>
If a job requires that you work on a particular product or website, make sure you review it before your interview, and make notes of the aspects that you can improve. 
            </li>

            <!-- Add more tips here -->

            <li>
Explain Your Thoughts, Ideas, and Design Process in Simple Terms:
<br>
           As a potential UX design candidate, you may be asked to explain your thoughts and ideas on specific products and processes, like how to create user personas.  For instance, if you want to make a design process less complicated, share your thoughts in a way that a non-specialist can understand. Also, regularly reading about UX design will help you share your ideas with ease and confidence.  </li>
